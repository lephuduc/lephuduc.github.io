### TLDR;

This is the first time I wrote a blog post that haven't a CTF write-up. So, if you enjoy it, please let me know. I'm planning to write some other blog posts in the future that I've never shared before; I think one year from the event will be a good time to share them. I hope you enjoy it, and have a great day!

## Global Cybersecurity Camp 2025 Taiwan?



> https://gcc.ac/

The Global Cybersecurity Camp (GCC) is a week-long annual international cybersecurity training program, with hosting responsibilities rotating among participating countries. The mission is to strengthen the global security community and cultivate future cybersecurity leaders. Each year, the top 50 students from member countries gather in a host nation to exchange experiences, build lifelong friendships, and learn from leading cybersecurity professionals. Organized by non-commercial education programs and communities, the camp is supported by industry leaders committed to fostering a safer digital world.

The story starting from the end of **Winter 2024**. I have some good news. Thankfully, I was chosen by our sponsor to be one of three students who will attend GCC this year. This is not my first time hearing about GCC; I already knew it from my trip to Singapore in 2023 and the GCC 2024 event in Thailand last year, **but I never thought it could feel so exciting like that.**

Today, I’ll share with you my perspective (POV) as a student attending GCC.

## Day 0: Departure

> ~9°C -  Sunday, February 9, 2025

### The "Delayed Airline"
My flight was scheduled to take off at 13:15 from Tan Son Nhat Airport (SGN) and arrive at Taoyuan Airport (TPE) at 16:30, so I went to the airport at 10 AM to check-in. However there was a problem - my flight got delayed. I have flown many times before, but this is the first time I have been in this situation.


Because we have GCC schedule like this.

![image](/images/GCC2025_images/0_gcc_schedule.png)

So I thought the flight was just delayed 2 and a half hours is fine (EST departure is 15:42), however, from Ho Chi Minh City it took me over 3h30m to arrive at Taoyuan airport. That means I'll miss the Ice-Breaking Party. It was the only way to meet everyone before the class, and I had no chance to introduce myself.

![image](/images/GCC2025_images/0_flight_line.png)

Anyway, I arrived at 8 PM then it took me about an hour to go through immigration and take an MRT to the hotel (Thankfully, The hotel was located at the airport Station)

![image](/images/GCC2025_images/0_landing.jpg)

### Fullon Hotel MRT A8

Taking the MRT from Taoyuan Airport to Fullon Hotel MRT A8 wasn’t far, and my impression was that the train ran very fast. The instructions were also very clear.

![image](/images/GCC2025_images/0_mrt.jpg)

As soon as I stepped outside, I immediately felt an **extremely cold wind** blowing against me (at a time when I wasn’t wearing a jacket). I didn’t even know how to describe it - it was very cold but also amazing. Idk:) but I loved that feeling; it was like the atmosphere in Nordic countries.

After arriving at the hotel, the first person I met was Arm, my roommate.We had a quick conversation. This is my first time sharing a room with a foreigner, and there will be many interesting things for us to discuss later. After that, when I went out to find some food with my Vietnamese friends, I felt like everything had already closed. I hadn't eaten anything, so I was very hungry, and **7-Eleven** was the only option. The food here was quite good (even though it wasn’t hot), but I rated it highly. That was my second impression of **Taiwan**.

![alt text](/images/GCC2025_images/0_711.png)

This is also the first time I met my Vietnamese friends (we already knew each other but hadn't met before). After that, we went back Hotel to set up our VMs and downloaded some stuff before tomorrow's class until 2:00 PM, and that was the end of **day 0**...

## Day 1: Making new friends 

> 13°C - Monday, February 10, 2025

### First breakfast
I went to bed at 2 AM but woke up at 7:30 AM. That was when a day in Taiwan truly began. I don’t have a habit of staying up late (because it’s very bad for health), but sometimes I have to do it for work. After preparing a few things and taking care of personal hygiene, we agreed to meet for breakfast at the hotel restaurant.

As soon as I stepped out of my room, the first thing that caught my eye was this view. I didn’t think it was perfect, but at that moment, I felt the fresh air. It might have been very cold outside, but I really liked it. Maybe it was a sign of a beautiful new day.

![alt text](/images/GCC2025_images/1_view.png)

I really enjoy having breakfast, although I don’t eat much. For me, a small piece of bread in the morning is enough. That’s why my breakfast is always quick. One more thing, I can’t forget a cup of coffee! In the hotel restaurant, there’s a coffee machine available and I usually drink a latte and epresso. I highly appreciate these types of coffee.

After a light and satisfying breakfast, we’re all set to head to the venue by 8:30 AM. The best part? It’s just a short 500-meter walk from the hotel, taking about 8 minutes, a perfect way to start the day. I absolutely love walking. Stepping outside, I’m greeted by the crisp, fresh air, which instantly wakes me up and cools me down. It’s such a refreshing feeling!

![alt text](/images/GCC2025_images/1_walk_line.png)

We’re walking to the venue in groups organized by country teams, but I’m sticking close to my staff and my group moderator. It’s a great way to bond and share some laughs before the day’s activities begin.

![alt text](/images/GCC2025_images/1_ontheway.png)

### The "押" button

So, we were at the training venue, and everything was going smoothly... until my Vietnamese friend decided to have a little "adventure."

Now, I don’t know how he managed it, but somehow he cracked open the button case and pressed the big red button that clearly said "押" (which means "push," by the way).

![alt text](/images/GCC2025_images/1_button.jpg)

Here’s the kicker: this wasn’t just any button. It was the emergency button. You know, the one that sets off alarms loud enough to wake the dead and sends everyone into a full-blown panic mode. And guess what? It worked like a charm. The alarms blared, people came running, and there he was, standing in the middle of it all like a deer in headlights. Everyone turned to stare at him, and let’s just say the look on his face was a mix of "I’m so sorry" and "Please, earth, swallow me whole."

To make things even better, the bathroom situation at this venue was already a comedy of errors. If you needed to use the toilet, you had to grab toilet paper from outside the bathroom before going in. So, naturally, once you were inside, you were on your own, no paper, no mercy. And the only buttons in there? One was placed ridiculously high and has nothing (like it was designed for giants), and the other was the emergency button, safely tucked away in a case... or so we thought.

My friend’s little "oops" moment turned him into the star of the show. He said everyone looked at him like he’d just set off the fire alarm during a final exam.  Moral of the story: If you see a button in a case that says "押," maybe just... don’t. Unless you’re ready for your 15 minutes of fame (and shame).


### New friends

When I walked into the training room and started greeting everyone, I noticed something amazing: my teammates were from all over the place: Japan, Taiwan, Korea, India, and even my roommate from Thailand. It was like a mini United Nations in there! What I love about events like GCC is how they push people from different backgrounds to interact and collaborate. Imagine being in a group with six people from six different countries, all working together on a single project. It’s the perfect recipe for learning, sharing, and creating something awesome. That’s exactly the kind of environment I thrive in, where I can connect with people, exchange experiences, and grow together.
After the opening ceremony and a few quick talks from the sponsors, we had a short break. This was when the real magic happened. Everyone started mingling, introducing themselves, and making new friends. It was like a cultural melting pot, and I was here for it!



Now, here’s where I decided to add a little cultural flair. In my country, especially during Lunar New Year, we have a tradition of giving red envelopes (called lì xì) with money inside as a way to wish people good luck and prosperity for the future. I thought, why not use this tradition to break the ice and make some new friends? So, I handed out a few envelopes to my new teammates from Korea and Singapore. Their reactions were priceless, some were surprised, some laughed, and others were genuinely touched. It was a small gesture, but it instantly created a connection.

![alt text](/images/GCC2025_images/1_envelope.jpg)


By the end of the break, I had not only made new friends but also shared a piece of my culture with them. It’s moments like these that remind me why I love events like GCC.They’re not just about learning new skills but also about building bridges between people and cultures. And who knows? Maybe next year, they’ll be the ones handing out red envelopes! Or continue to receive my red envelopes too:D

### Lunch

After that incident, since our lesson didn’t start until the afternoon, we decided to go for lunch. That day, we went down to B1F to find something to eat. Luckily, we found some food we had never tried before.

![alt text](/images/GCC2025_images/1_lunch.png)

The price was around 174 NT (if I remember correctly), which I thought was reasonable and good, though I’m sure you could find something even better. That was the first local food I had eaten at the venue. After that, we headed back to the training room and got ready for the first lesson.

### Lesson started

Our first lesson was on **"Introduction to Threat Modeling"** presented by Mr. Donavan. Threat modelling allows us to understand how threat actors can attack our systems, and how we can pre-empt said threat actors whilst a system is still in the midst of the design phase. I thought it's required skill for everyone who interested in cybersecurity. Luckily, I had already studied this topic in college, but thanks to our trainer, I still learned a lot from him.

![alt text](/images/GCC2025_images/1_donavan.jpg)

After that, we moved on to the next lesson, **"Writing a Code Sanitizer."** This lecture taught us how to use sanitizers and even build one ourselves by tweaking a small compiler called chibicc. We explored topics like:

- How to write secure code with sanitizers,
- The inner workings of a C compiler, and
- Static and dynamic analysis techniques for C programs.

The first two lessons were very interesting. By this time, we also learned that each group would have its own project. There were a total of 8 groups with 4 different topics, meaning 2 groups would work on the same topic. At the end of the GCC, we had to present our projects, and the staff would choose the 2 best projects as winners. The winners would receive 2 CREST certificate exam vouchers as prizes.

### Dinner


The lesson finish at 7:00 PM, then we returned to the hotel, and below the hotel, there was also a mall with a wide variety of food options. I wasn’t sure what to choose, so I followed my friend Nam Pham. We ended up at a hotpot restaurant with some friends from Thailand and even the two trainers.

While waiting for the food to arrive, I sat next to Mr. Donavan and exchanged a few thoughts about the day’s lessons. I mentioned that I actually had more architectural materials related to the session but hadn’t had the chance to show him yet. Suddenly, an idea popped into my head, and I asked him if I could show him right then and there. He laughed and said, “If you don’t mind, go ahead!” So, I pulled out my laptop and external hard drive, opened the slides, and started showing him the system architectures from the afternoon’s lecture, right there at the hotpot table. It was truly a memorable experience.

{{< static_images "GCC2025_images/1_hotpot0.jpg" "GCC2025_images/1_hotpot1.jpg" >}}

We continued chatting until the food arrived. As for the food, I thought the hotpot was quite delicious, with plenty of meat. However, I still didn’t think it was the best dish I’d ever had, so I’d say it was reasonably priced and a decent option if you want to try something new.

After the meal, I returned to the VIP room with my teammates to start working on our group project. We began planning and discussing what we wanted to do for our project (our topic was SSO-tracker). From there, we had a fun and productive time working together until the end of the day. I went to bed at midnight, marking the end of Day 1...


## Day 2: Adapting Step by Step

> 16°C - Tuesday, February 11, 2025

### It's Reverse Engineering

I’ll skip the breakfast part because it was similar to the previous day (just a small bread). Instead, I want to focus on the two lessons of the day, both of which were about Reverse Engineering and covered both the morning and afternoon sessions. If you’ve been reading my blog recently, you’ll notice that I’ve only been discussing Reverse Engineering challenges. So, the fun part is that these sessions felt like they were tailor-made for me, haha.

![](/images/GCC2025_images/2_scoreboard.JPG)

The lessons were presented by Hiroshi Suzuki and Naoki Takayama, and I really enjoyed them. They also included CTF challenges at the end, which I loved. I managed to take the top spot on the scoreboard for a while (in the picture), which I’ll discuss later.

### Lunch and Conversations

Today, my teammates and I decided to go out for lunch together. Since I had no idea where to go, we explored the mall in the venue and luckily found a great spot. The dish was a soup with noodles, but the best part? The staff were Vietnamese, so I could easily communicate with the waiter and help my friends decide what to order. It was a smooth experience, and I was really happy about it.

![](/images/GCC2025_images/2_menu.jpg)

Since this was the first time we ate together, we had some meaningful conversations and exchanged cultural insights. For example, I asked my Japanese friends about their traditions, what they say before, during, or after meals. It was also the first time we had deeper conversations with teammates from Korea and Japan. This was a great opportunity for everyone to connect, and it felt really meaningful to me.

![](/images/GCC2025_images/2_lunch.jpg)

As for the food, I highly recommend this place because it’s reasonably priced and the food is really, really good (you can see the menu in the picture, though I’d already eaten half of my meal before taking the photo). It was perfect for me, but sadly, I won’t be trying it again in the next few days because I want to experience more local food. However, I promised myself that if I ever come back, I’ll definitely eat there again.

### Back to the Training Room
After lunch, we returned to the training room. While waiting for the next session to start, I went over to the trainers’ table and had a conversation with them. As I mentioned earlier, I really enjoyed these lessons because Reverse Engineering is my main focus in cybersecurity. I asked them about other topics related to Reverse Engineering and discussed the Flare-On Challenge, which is one of my favorites. I love doing that, haha.

### Tea break

Thanks to the organizers for knowing me so well, haha! They were incredibly thoughtful and prepared tea drinks for us, which made the experience even better. The tea was not only refreshing but also helped keep everyone focused and energized throughout the class. I highly recommend these tea drinks, they were delicious and hit the spot perfectly for me. It’s small touches like these that make a big difference, and I truly appreciated their effort.

![](/images/GCC2025_images/2_tea.jpg)

The afternoon session focused on the CTF challenges, and this is where I actually made some new friends, haha. As I mentioned earlier, I was in first place on the scoreboard for a while, and I was proud of it. At one point, Arm (my teammate who was sitting next to me) told me that his friend said I was "kod hode" (I don't know if I type correctly:V), which means “You are very brutal” in Thai. I didn’t know what it meant at first, but by the end of the day, I found out.

Arm suggested I use the phrase with his Thai friends, and I did. From there, I not only learned a new word but also found a fun way to connect with others. Every time I saw them, I’d say "kod hode", and we’d all laugh so much, haha. This helped me make a new friend, I didn’t know his name at first, but his personality was really funny, and we laughed every time we met.

### Dinner and Group Work

Sadly, I didn’t take any pictures of dinner, and I don’t even remember what I ate (maybe chicken). The only thing I remember is that we also found another food place with Vietnamese staff, and the food was really, really good (yes, it was that good too). After dinner, we all went back to the VIP room to continue working on our group project. It was a productive session, and by the end, we all knew what we needed to do to move the project forward smoothly. Since the VIP room closed at 11 PM, we decided to continue working in my room (since Arm and I are in the same team). We worked until 2:00 AM and then went to sleep. That was the end of Day 2...


## Day 3: A special day

> 17°C - Wednesday, February 12, 2025

### 4th lesson

Since this is the third day of GCC, I don't have so much things to say then I'll talk about the 2 lesson today.

This day I have 2 lesson: once is "Deep-dive in OT security and attacks" and another one with very long name "Detection Engineering with Threat Intelligence: Techniques of consuming and creating threat intelligence for Detection Engineering".

I don't know so much things and have no idea what is OT security, then this course tell me that Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Operational Technology (OT) environments have become prime targets for cyberattacks in recent years, and this course dives deep into understanding and defending against these threats. We start by analyzing and categorizing ICS-related malware dating back to 2010, breaking down the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by attackers. From there, we explore attack paths, protocol analysis, and attack targets specific to OT environments. To make things even more practical, the course includes hands-on simulations of protocol attacks that mimic real-world malware attack paths. These exercises help us understand the current pain points in ICS/OT systems, learn how to analyze communication protocols, and assess the attack posture of malware. By the end of the course, we’ll not only have a clearer picture of how attackers exploit these critical systems but also gain the skills needed to defend them effectively. This is a must-know area for anyone in cybersecurity, especially as industries like energy, manufacturing, and utilities rely heavily on these systems to keep the world running.

![](/images/GCC2025_images/3_OT_security.jpg)

The other things I know is there is too many virtual machines that we need to downloaded before going to class but sadly, I forgot it. Fortunately, My teammate already downloaded, So I must borrow USB with data from my teammate, thank you so much. 

Thanks for the great lesson, let go to lunch...

### Lunch

Lunch is always the best part of the day, and today I tried something new: rice with curry.

![](/images/GCC2025_images/3_Curry.JPEG)

It wasn’t my first time eating curry, but this one reminded me of a dish I’d tried before: an Indian curry soup. The flavors were rich and comforting, and I really enjoyed it. If I remember correctly, the price was around $150, which I thought was reasonable for the portion and quality. While it might not be the best food I’ve ever had, it’s definitely worth trying if you’re in the area. This place is located on B1F of the training venue, which is super convenient since it’s close to our location. Plus, there are so many other food options nearby that I’m excited to explore in the coming days.

After lunch, I always grab a cup of coffee and it’s my secret weapon to stay awake during the afternoon sessions. Coffee is more than just a necessity for me; it’s a hobby and something I genuinely love. With my caffeine fix in hand, I headed back to the training room, ready for the next class.

The next lesson, which had a very long name, was about Threat Intelligence. This is one of my favorite topics and a major focus in my cybersecurity journey. We dove into using tools like Elastic and other threat-hunting platforms, which was both challenging and exciting. Learning how to analyze and track threats in real-time is such a crucial skill, and I’m glad we got hands-on experience with these powerful tools.

### Dinner 

After the afternoon lesson, the organizers provided dinner, and I was thrilled to see that they had ordered pizza and fried chicken. I don’t often eat pizza back in Vietnam, so this was a real treat for me. There’s something about the combination of gooey cheese, savory toppings, and crispy crust that I absolutely love, it felt like a little taste of comfort food after a long day of learning.

![](/images/GCC2025_images/3_pizza.JPEG)

While enjoying the meal, I had the chance to chat with so many people. It was a great opportunity to connect with others who share the same passion for cybersecurity. I even ran into someone I recognized from a previous event, I think it was a CTF competition we’d both participated in. It was such a small-world moment, and we ended up reminiscing about the challenges we’d faced back then. On top of that, I got to catch up with friends I’d made earlier during the event and meet some new faces too. These kinds of moments, sharing food, stories, and laughter, are what make events like GCC so special. It’s not just about the technical knowledge.

### Industrial Session 

Today was a special day because we had an Industrial Session at the end of the day. This session was hosted by representatives from the sponsor companies, who shared insights about their organizations and talked about job opportunities. It was a great chance to learn more about the industry and connect with professionals who are actively hiring.

![](/images/GCC2025_images/3_slide.JPEG)

The session wasn’t all serious, though there were some funny moments too. The speakers had a great sense of humor, and their jokes had everyone laughing. It was a nice way to lighten the mood after a long day of intense learning. I think we all needed that moment of laughter to unwind and recharge.

![](/images/GCC2025_images/3_slide2.jpg)

By the time the Industrial Session wrapped up, it was already 8 PM. The day had flown by, and I was ready to head back to the hotel to rest. It’s amazing how much you can pack into a single day-learning, networking, and even a few good laughs...

### Get back to the hotel

As I stepped outside, I noticed something unexpected, it was raining. Thankfully, it wasn’t pouring too heavily, so my friend and I tried to stay close to the building to avoid getting soaked.

Sadly, I wasn’t prepared for the rain because I didn’t have an umbrella. So, we ended up walking through the drizzle. But you know what? It turned into a surprisingly nice moment. Along the way, I started chatting with some of the other attendees, and we ended up walking and talking together. There was something special about it, sharing stories and laughter while the rain fell lightly around us. It felt almost cozy and really cold at the same time. 🌧️⛈️

Once we got back to the hotel, we immediately dove into our groupwork. The day might have been long, but it was incredibly productive. We worked late into the night, as usual, and finally called it a day around 2 AM. It was the end of another effective and memorable day, one filled with learning, laughter, and even a little adventure in the rain...

## Day 4: It’s almost the end...

> 14°C - Thursday, February 13, 2025

### Morning Routine

Despite pulling another late night working on our project until 2 AM, somehow I managed to get up at 8 AM. You already know where I headed first - straight to that coffee machine in the hotel restaurant. I mean, I might skip breakfast sometimes, but coffee is never. It's basically my morning superpower at this point. Today I treated myself to a cappuccino, and oh man, that first sip of perfectly blended coffee and milk was exactly what I needed. You know what they say: The day doesn't really start until you've had your coffee. ☕

It's kind of funny writing about Day 4 now, almost a month later. While some of the little details might be a bit fuzzy (sorry about that), the important stuff is still super clear in my mind. It was one of those days you just don't forget, you know?

The schedule for today got me super excited because it lined up perfectly with what I love most, low-level security stuff! We kicked off the morning with this intense Kernel Exploitation lesson, then jumped into Car Hacking in the afternoon. Now, I won't pretend I'm some kernel Pwn expert or anything, but there's just something about diving into these low-level system details that gets me really fired up. It's like solving a complex puzzle, figuring out how everything works at its core, and then finding creative ways to bend those rules a bit.

![kernel exploit](/images/GCC2025_images/4_kernel_hacking.JPG)

What I really loved was how the instructors balanced everything, they didn't just throw theory at us, but showed us real, practical ways to work around these protections. The hands-on exercises were the best part, especially when we got to play with cool techniques like Dirtycred and Dirtypipe. You should have seen how excited I was when the instructors shared stories about weird kernel bugs they'd found in the wild, it made everything feel so much more real and relatable. As someone who's still finding their way in the kernel exploitation world, getting to actually try these techniques instead of just reading about them was exactly what I needed. Thanks to our trainer: Cherie-Anne Lee.

### Lunch

Due to our strict schedule (we had to be back at the training room by 1:00 PM), we decided to grab lunch at the B1F mall again for convenience. There were still many food options we hadn't tried there yet! After looking around, we narrowed it down to two choices: a rice place and a noodle shop. I'd heard the rice place wasn't that great (someone had already tried it), and interestingly, we spotted a Vietnamese staff member at the noodle shop. So you can probably guess which one I chose haha... 

![4_lunch](/images/GCC2025_images/4_lunch_food.JPEG)

I got so caught up in the conversation that I totally forgot to snap a picture of my food! But hey, I did manage to get a shot of my friend's bowl - we ordered the same thing anyway. The noodles were absolutely fantastic, and for just $150 NT, it was such a steal...

<!-- ![4_lunch](/images/GCC2025_images/4_lunch_group.JPEG) -->

On previous days, I had been eating separately, either with my Vietnamese team or with my project teammates. But today, I decided to bring everyone together! We were lucky enough to find a table that could fit all seven of us, and it turned into such a wonderful time. Looking at our group photo now, it brings back such special memories. This was actually the first time my Vietnamese friends and project teammates got to really talk and get to know each other. It was like watching two different worlds come together over a shared meal.

### Car Hacking

The highlight of my day was definitely the Car Hacking session. When it comes to cybersecurity, there are two things that really get me excited: Reverse Engineering and anything hardware-related. Even though I don't have much hands-on experience with IoT devices (besides some work at my previous job), I absolutely love tinkering with circuit boards and IoT modules. There's just something fascinating about understanding how these physical components work together.

But working with IoT stuff isn't always smooth sailing. Our group ran into some trouble when our board wouldn't play nice with our VM. We tried everything we could think of, checking connections, restarting the system,... Nothing seemed to work until our amazing trainer Kamel stepped in. It was like magic watching him work, a few tweaks here and there, a board restart, and suddenly everything was working perfectly. Talk about a lifesaver, thanks Kamel!

![car hacking](/images/GCC2025_images/4_carhacking.jpg)

The Car Hacking session it wasn't just about cars, it opened up this whole new world of automotive security that I never knew before. Our trainer gave us actual car hardware to play with, and we got to try real security testing firsthand. What really got me excited was learning how these techniques don't just stop at cars, they work for all sorts of IoT stuff, medical devices, and even industrial controls. It's like getting a Swiss Army knife of security skills. Many students who took this course before me went on to discover new vulnerabilities and make real contributions to the field. That really got me thinking about all the possibilities ahead...

### Head back to the hotel and Dinner

On our way back to the hotel, we decided to take a little detour to find some dinner. The weather surprised us, it was super cold with these strong gusts of wind that made me wish I'd brought an extra layer. That's how we ended up discovering this cool new path back to the hotel that I'd never noticed before.

Along the way, we stumbled upon something cute, these adorable ducks hanging out by the lake. I couldn't help but happy as they waddled around going "quack quack." Sometimes the best moments are these random little discoveries... 🦆

![duck](/images/GCC2025_images/4_duck.JPEG)

After braving the cold for a while, we spotted this cozy-looking food place and practically ran inside to warm up. We had no idea if the food would be good, but at that point, we were ready to try anything.

![4_dinner_food](/images/GCC2025_images/4_dinner_food.JPEG)

I ended up ordering this amazing rice dish with egg that had this curry-like sauce, but honestly, it was even better than regular curry. It only cost 100NT, probably the best deal I've found in Taiwan so far. Everything about it was just perfect: the taste, the portion size, everything.

The dinner turned into this awesome little cultural exchange. I was there with my Vietnamese friends and two of my teammates, and we just talked about everything under the sun, our different cultures, traditions, you name it. I even picked up some Thai words (though I'm probably butchering the pronunciation, haha).

![4_dinner_food](/images/GCC2025_images/4_groupwork.JPEG)

After dinner, we knew we had to get serious, it was our last night to work on the group project before tomorrow's presentation. We all headed back to my room and got down to business, polishing our slides and making sure everything was perfect. We ended up working until 3 AM, yeah, I know, super late, but when you're working with an amazing team on something you care about, those late hours just fly by. Worth every minute of lost sleep if you ask me. And that's how Day 4 came to an end...



## Day 5: Hustle and Excited

> 17° - Friday, February 14, 2025
> 
> Yesterday, on the way I get back to the hotel, I quickly go to the 711 buy some pen cuz I have some plan for the next day, which I'll tell you later.

### Presentation
I woke up at 7:30 AM after only 4 hours and 30 minutes of sleep, which isn’t great, but it reminded me of the days when I used to play CTF. It’s been a habit of mine since I played CTF back in university.

I didn’t eat breakfast because I didn’t have enough time. We had to be at the training venue by 8:30 AM to test the equipment (microphone and projector) before every group’s presentation.

My group is Group 3, and we were the 3rd to present. I don’t know why, but on the last day, I was feeling so confident because we had already completed the project, and everyone in the group knew exactly what they were doing (like, fully understood and were confident). But right before our presentation, I got so nervous... I know it was my first time presenting in English, but I don’t think English was the problem. It was just one of those things that made me nervous, haha...

![5_present](/images/GCC2025_images/5_present.jpg)

We started presenting at 9:12 AM, and everything went smoothly. We had a time limit because each group only got 10 minutes to present everything about the project, including the demonstration. I was the last presenter in the group, and by the time it was my turn, the time was up. I couldn’t present everything fully, but I think it still went as smoothly as I had hoped.

And after it was finished, I felt so good. I just put everything behind me and didn’t worry about whether the result was good or not. My group had done their best, and I really appreciated that.

### A little break

At this time, we have a short time break while waiting for the staff rating the group project. Remember, this day is 14-Feb, also the valentine day. So I see people giving the chocolate each other.
Happy, I also received the candy from the friends. Thanks haha.

Luckily, we were the group who win the prize, I didn't expect that but it worth for our hard work. Thanks to my teammate for the hard work. I really appriciate that. I really happy when we're receive the top prize. We've going to stage and receive the prize haha.


There were a photo of members from each country. For Vietnam, we only have 4 people this year, one staff and 3 students as well. And after that, I have to do something. Since I known this is the last day we've met each other. So I have plan to have the signature of GCC participant. So, after a while, I have the signature of my team mate on the name plate. I love it so much.

![5_signature](/images/GCC2025_images/5_group_signature.jpeg)


After that, I also request signature of others and you known, I very happy when I got so much, like it's full of my Name plate. I take it as a part of my memory and it also a priceless souvernir for me. I promise I will keep it careful and never forget that. Thanks to all people right there.

### City tour

We don't have too much time on lunch cuz we must get back to the hotel and choose

There are 2 options for us to choose where we go. For me, I never goes to these place before so I dont known which one is better:

#### Option 1: Taipei 101

![alt text](/images/GCC2025_images/5_taipei101.png)

> Taipei 101, once the world's tallest building, is a must-visit on any Citi Tour of Taiwan. This iconic 508-meter skyscraper offers breathtaking 360-degree views of Taipei from its observation deck, along with high-end shopping and dining. Its innovative earthquake-resistant design and stunning New Year's fireworks make it a top attraction. A visit here combines modern architecture, cultural significance, and panoramic cityscapes, perfect for travelers exploring Taiwan's highlights.

It's a great place for one who love the high place and building, also for me:> but you know,some how I choose randomly, so it's the option 2.

#### Option 2: National Palace Museum

![alt text](/images/GCC2025_images/5_museum.png)

> Alongside Taipei 101, the National Palace Museum is another essential stop on City Tour of Taiwan. Home to over 700,000 ancient Chinese artifacts, it showcases treasures like the famous Jadeite Cabbage and Mao Gong Ding, offering a deep dive into 5,000 years of Chinese history and culture. Located in Shilin District, it’s easily accessible from Taipei 101, making it a perfect pairing of modern marvels and imperial heritage.

Since I don’t know too much about the artifacts, I’ll just post this here, hope you like it too, haha!

Some "little gift" for someone.

This place made me feel like I have to come back a second time to fully enjoy everything there. I hope I can return someday. I miss it so much already! :<

### Party

At the end of the day, we headed back to Taipei to celebrate with a party. While waiting for it to start, we went up to the rooftop to enjoy the view. Here is how it looked:

![alt text](/images/GCC2025_images/5_rooftop_view.jpeg)

![alt text](/images/GCC2025_images/5_rooftop_view2.jpeg)


I could almost feel the fresh air even though I’m just looking at these photos now. The view alone feels so comforting. We also stopped by the mall nearby to hunt for... LEGO (of course!). I just have to say, I love this place so much.

There’s so much I want to share about the party because it was incredibly fun and exciting. First, the food. It was amazing. Just look at that beef (see below?). Now I’m hungry all over again, haha!


![alt text](/images/GCC2025_images/5_party_food.jpeg)

We had time to drink black beer together (okay fine, I can handle alcohol but just a little... maybe... haha). We chatted with each other and got tons of chances to meet new friends - like real professionals and stuff.

Then came the stage time! Each team got to introduce themselves and thank the organizers. After the serious stuff? KARAOKE TIME! You know I couldn't resist joining in. I even bravely contributed a super professional performance of "Cupid" (yes, the K-pop song... but only because it has an English version and is easy enough for me:>).

Fun fact: That's literally the only K-pop song I can sing. But hey, I nailed it! (Okay, maybe the audience was nice enough to cheer anyway.)

![alt text](/images/GCC2025_images/5_sing.png)

I hope you all enjoyed the song! The party was absolutely incredible - so many wonderful moments...

As all good things must end, we eventually had to say our goodbyes. Some friends were leaving that night or early next morning, meaning this might be the last time we'd see each other during this event. We exchanged heartfelt farewells and wished everyone safe travels. Until we meet again, you all my friends 💞.


### The last night

Since it was our final night in Taiwan, I knew exactly how I wanted to spend it with my favorite group of guys, making the most of every last minute together.

![alt text](/images/GCC2025_images/5_night_walking.JPEG)

We set out with no particular plan, just wandering the streets of Taipei, laughing at inside jokes and sharing stories from our trip. The city felt alive at night, with its buzzing night markets and the warm glow of convenience stores every few blocks. We lost track of both time and distance, only realizing how far we’d walked when we checked our phones 2:00 AM already.

There’s something special about those late-night adventures when you’re with the right people. No rush, no schedule, just good company and the freedom to explore. 

Strolled into the hotel at 2:30 AM, completely exhausted but still buzzing from the night’s energy. As I finally crashed into bed, it hit me: Day 5 wasn’t just memorable, it was the kind of night that makes trips unforgettable. All thanks to the bros.

## Day 6: The Last Day in Taiwan

> 18° - Saturday, February 15, 2025

### A Relaxing Morning

Finally, a rest day and sadly, the last day of this unforgettable journey in Taiwan. For the first time since I arrived, I woke up feeling completely refreshed. No alarms, no deadlines, no pressure. It was such a rare and comforting feeling. I had a full night of good sleep, something I hadn’t experienced in days. Maybe it was the exhaustion catching up with me, or maybe it was the thought of having no responsibilities for the day. Either way, I felt so relaxed and ready to enjoy every moment.

Since I didn’t have any specific plans, I decided to join the Thailand team for the day. We had to check out of the hotel by 12 PM, so we spent the morning exploring the area around the hotel. The weather was perfect cool, fresh air, a bright blue sky, and the kind of peaceful atmosphere that makes you want to slow down and take it all in. The buildings around the hotel were modern yet charming, and the people we passed by seemed genuinely happy. It was one of those moments where everything just felt right.

![alt text](/images/GCC2025_images/6_view_freshair.JPEG)

I was so caught up in the moment that I forgot to take pictures. Well, almost. I did manage to snap a quick photo of myself enjoying the view, but honestly, no picture could truly capture how beautiful and serene it felt to be there.

![alt text](/images/GCC2025_images/6_view_duc.JPEG)

### A Supermarket Adventure

While walking and chatting with the Thailand team, we stumbled upon a supermarket. It was the perfect opportunity to pick up some souvenirs and snacks for my family and coworkers back home. The problem? I had no idea what to buy. Everything looked so interesting, but I couldn’t tell what was good or bad. So, I did what any indecisive person would do I chose randomly based on my instincts. 

![alt text](/images/GCC2025_images/6_supermarket.JPEG)

To my surprise, every single thing I picked turned out to be amazing. Some items looked cheap but were incredibly delicious. It made me realize how much I love discovering new things, even if it’s just snacks from a supermarket. This little shopping trip turned into a fun and memorable experience, and I couldn’t wait to share these goodies with everyone back home.

### Exploring Taipei City

After checking out of the hotel, we headed to Taipei City for one last adventure. The journey took about 45 minutes on the metro, and as always, I enjoyed every second of it. There’s something so calming about traveling by metro watching the city pass by through the windows, feeling the gentle sway of the train, and listening to the quiet hum of conversations around you.

![alt text](/images/GCC2025_images/6_metro.png)

When we arrived in Taipei, the city greeted us with its vibrant energy and stunning views. The mix of modern skyscrapers and traditional architecture was breathtaking. Every corner seemed to have its own unique charm, and I couldn’t help but feel a little sad knowing this was my last day here.

![alt text](/images/GCC2025_images/6_taipei_view.JPEG)

We spent the afternoon wandering through the streets, soaking in the sights and sounds of the city. From bustling markets to quiet parks, Taipei had so much to offer. I tried to capture as much as I could with my camera, but honestly, some moments are better left as memories.

### Heading to the Airport

As the day came to an end, it was time to head back to the hotel, grab our luggage, and make our way to the airport. Walking through the city one last time, I couldn’t help but feel a mix of emotions gratitude for the incredible experiences I’d had, sadness that it was all coming to an end, and excitement to share my stories with everyone back home.

![alt text](/images/GCC2025_images/6_airport.JPEG)

When I boarded the plane that night, I felt a deep sense of longing and bittersweet memories come over me. Looking out the window at the night sky, I couldn’t shake the feeling that this entire trip had been like a dream a beautiful, unforgettable dream that I didn’t want to wake up from.

### A Heartfelt Goodbye

Before I end this post, I just want to say thank you. Thank you to everyone who made this journey so special. From my teammates and trainers to the friends I made along the way, each of you played a part in creating memories that I’ll cherish forever.

Maybe next year, the GCC will be held in Vietnam. If that happens, I hope to see you all again and create even more amazing memories together. Until then, take care and stay safe. ❤️
