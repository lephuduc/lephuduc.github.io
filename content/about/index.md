Hi, Im' Jinn from **The Vietnamese Gang**

Information Security at University of Information Technology VNU HCM city.
I'm interested in learning and solving security related issues then enjoying CTF/Binary/reverse. 

This blog will be the place to share my journey to learn and play CTF during my second year at school.
If you're interested, you can make friends via my discord **jinnnnnnnnn**.
If you have a question about me or else, just send a letter.
