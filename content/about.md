## Yes, I'm jinn

Hi, I'm **Le Phu Duc**, but you can call me **Jinn** for simplicity.

I'm a student from [VNUHCM - University of Information Technology](https://en.uit.edu.vn/), currently working at [ECQ](https://e-cq.net/) as **Security Analyst**.

I love playing **CTFs** and exploring cybersecurity. In particular, I'm already diving into **Reverse Engineering** and other binary-related topics.
I'm also playing for [Project Sekai.](https://sekai.team/).

Since you're reading my blog, I hope we can be friends.

<----- So, check here real quick.

Hope you enjoy it and have a great day!

## Journeys Around the World

Yes, I love traveling. Anyway, I hope that someday I can visit other countries (Japan, ~~Korea~~, USA, ...) as well. I love experiencing different cultures...
